Convex Hull
===========

This repository contains an applet that calculates the convex hull of a set of points through a divide and conquer algorithm. Wikipedia defines a convex hull as follows: "The convex hull or convex envelope of a set X of points in the Euclidean plane or Euclidean space is the smallest convex set that contains X." An easy analogy is to think of a set of pins tacked onto a board, with a rubber band stretched around the perimeter.  The rubberband approximates the convex hull of the set of points.

In Action
=========

You can see the applet in action at http://www.giancarloanemone.com/applet.html. Note: You must have the java plugin installed and be accessing the website from firefox for the applet to work.
